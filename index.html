      <p>I was born in 1994 and moved to Prague in&nbsp;2008. From 2013 until 2018 I studied <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/ug/bsc-psychology/" alt="BSc Psychology at Goldsmiths">Psychology</a>, <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-contemporary-art-theory/" alt="MA Contemporary Art Theory at Goldsmiths">Contemporary Art&nbsp;Theory</a>, and <a href="https://schoolcommunicationarts.com" alt="School of Communication Arts">Art&nbsp;Direction</a> in London, UK. Since returning to&nbsp;Prague in 2018, I've&nbsp;been working primarily in&nbsp;design and desktop publishing.</p>

      <p>I started learning UX/UI design during the lockdown of 2020, which felt like a natural progression of&nbsp;my experience with graphic design, but then out of curiosity I started on a&nbsp;Codecademy <a href="https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path-b/" alt="Codecademy frontend engineering course">frontend&nbsp;engineering course</a>, learned Javascript and React, and have been coding since. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;currently looking for my first&nbsp;junior frontend job.</p>

      <p>In my spare time, I try not to burn bread rolls, teach my dog to sit and do a good <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/crane-pose/" alt="What is a bakasana?">bakasana</a>.</p>

      <p>You can find my current and completed projects&nbsp;on <a href="https://github.com/vladdjpg" alt="My GitHub profile">GitHub</a>, and email me anytime at&nbsp;vlad&nbsp;@&nbsp;frolov&nbsp;dot&nbsp;cz</p>

      <p>Have a great day!</p>
